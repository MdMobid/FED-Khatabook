# Khatabook Auto Reminder System

## Overview

The Khatabook Auto Reminder System is like a *digital ledger* that helps track money owed and borrowed. Its main purpose is to **automatically send email reminders** to people when their credit payments are due or overdue, preventing bad debt. You can also use it to *manage users*, *record credit transactions*, and *generate reports* through a simple command-line interface.
